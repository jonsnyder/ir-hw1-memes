Early life and career
Prabhu Deva was born in Mysore, Karnataka and grew up in Alwarpet, Chennai, Tamil Nadu.
He belongs to the Lingayat community.
Prabhu Deva was inspired by his father, Mugur Sundar (known as Sundaram Master), who was a dance master for popular South Indian movies.
He took dancing as his career and passion, learning Indian dance forms such as Bharatanatyam as well as Western styles.
He is widely considered to be one of Indian cinema's greatest dancers and choreographers;
Prabhu Deva has revolutionized some of the aspects of dance and choreography in modern popular Indian cinema.
His brothers Raju Sundaram and Nagendra Prasad are also established South Indian choreographers.
From choreography he went on to establish himself as an actor.
His dance steps helped him become a star in Kollywood (the Tamil film industry).
Prabhu Deva's first movie as a dance director was Vetri Vizha.
He has since choreographed over 100 movies.
Before starting as a full-time actor, he appeared as a background dancer for a song in the Tamil film Agni Natchathiram.
His first role as a hero was in Indhu (1994) with actress Roja.
Deva's success resulted largely from his dancing.
In 1999, Deva, Shobhana and A.
R.
Rahman performed with a Tamil cinema dancing troupe at the " Michael Jackson and Friends" concert in Munich, Germany.

This was eventually confirmed by Nayantara, who also stated their intention to marry one another.
After a year-long court-case filed by Ramlath against her husband and Nayantara, she finally accepted Prabhu Deva's request for divorce in 2010.
After a lot of consistent denial for the divorce, it was officially sanctioned on 2nd July, 2011.
Though Prabhu Deva and Nayantara marriage was anticipated mostly, it is said that the duo have separated and Nayantara started to act in the film

Benny Lava
Kalluri Vaanil
The Tamil song became widely known to the English internet audience for its phonetic lyrics.

On 18 August 2008, a music video for the song " Kalluri Vaanil " from the Indian - Tamil movie Pennin Manathai Thottu was uploaded to YouTube by Mike Sutton (Youtube user Buffalax).
The video was created as a soramimi, edited to include incorrect English subtitles that phonetically approximate the original Tamil lyrics.
The name Benny Lava comes from Sutton's homophonic translation of the Tamil lead line " Kalluri vaanil kaayndha nilaavo ?" as " My loony bun is fine, Benny Lava!
" (original meaning: "The moon (metaphor for'my love') that scorched the college campus").
The video led other YouTube users to refer to Prabhu Deva as "Benny Lava".
Reactions to the "Kalluri Vaanil" soramimi were mixed.
Some felt that the video was done in "good fun" while others worried that their culture was being mocked.
The video was described by the Philippine Daily Inquirer as a "Catchy melody, a battalion of back-up dancers, colorful costumes, impressive vocal gymnastics, jaw-dropping choreography this music video has it all.
And if those aren't enough, the person who uploaded this vid also provided subtitles so you can sing along.
They aren't the real lyrics though, but just what they sound in English, resulting in a lot of nonsense." The music video was featured on The Colbert Report on 4 December 2008 and appeared on the Heavy Metal documentary Global Metal.
As of at least April 1, 2011, the original video has been removed because of the disabling of Buffalax's YouTube account.
However, several other users have uploaded copies of the original video on their YouTube accounts.
