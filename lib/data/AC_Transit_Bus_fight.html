Incident
The incident took place aboard an AC Transit bus.
The incident took place in downtown Oakland on an Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District (AC Transit) Line NL bus bound for San Francisco, and involved a black man, identified only as Michael, and an older white bearded man identified as Thomas Alexander Bruso, who later came to be referred to as " Epic Beard Man ".
The events in the bus were recorded by Iyanna Washington.
In the video, Bruso is seen wearing a light blue T-shirt that reads "I AM a Motherfucker " on the back.
Bruso is seated across from Michael near the rear of the bus.
The cause of the altercation is unclear, but the conversation quickly becomes heated, with Michael angrily asking Bruso, "Why's a brother got to spit shine your shoes?" Thomas has stated in later interviews that Michael tried to make his statement racial.
Thomas then tells how he was referring to a person that "was gonna shine his shoes" and that a brother "could be anyone." After additional charged exchange, Bruso says, "you ain't scaring this white boy," and moves to the front of the bus, in an act of de-escalation.
Both men continue trading verbal barbs and Michael stands up after several seconds and walks towards Bruso's seat at the front of the bus.
Much of their conversation is inaudible, and some riders discourage Michael from approaching Bruso, while others encourage him to attack and use anti-white slurs.
Michael suddenly swings at Bruso during the verbal exchange.
Very angry, Bruso stands and delivers several punches, knocking Michael to the floor.
View of the men is lost briefly while Washington moves closer to the commotion;
when view resumes, Bruso is shown with Michael, who is now bleeding from facial injuries, in his grasp.
Bruso releases Michael, exclaiming "I told you not to fuck with me!", and then exits the bus, and is still yelling when the bus makes its next stop.
After another exchange, Michael returns to his seat in the rear of the bus.
Washington then takes a bag Bruso left behind and carries it to the back of the bus.
Washington offers Michael the use of her recording if he wishes to press charges, but Michael never acknowledges the offer, instead requesting an ambulance (his pronunciation of the word "ambulance" in AAVE as sounding like "ambalance" or "amber-lamps" has been satirized in numerous videos on YouTube).
In a second video, Bruso, now on the street, continues to yell about the fight.
He loudly mentions Vietnam and kicks a newspaper dispenser before walking away.
Both men were treated at a local hospital for their injuries.
Bruso underwent psychiatric evaluation at John George Psychiatric Pavilion in San Leandro.
Neither man was arrested.
Videographer's response
On February 17, 2010, Washington posted her own perspective of the events on YouTube.
In this video, Washington says she hopes to "clear some things up." See @ (0:45).
She goes on later to say, "I would like to apologize to anyone who took offense to any part of this video." Id.
@ (3:15—3:21).
Responding to allegations that Michael was her "companion," Washington makes clear, "I've never seen these two gentlemen ever before in my life", and claims she did not intend to steal Bruso's bag.
In a subsequent interview, when asked if he got his "stuff back," Bruso said Sheriff's deputies ultimately did return his belongings, except an identification card and some money, "about three (3) hours later." See @ (3:55—4:05).
Washington also appeared in a local CBS news video interview giving her version of events.
Thomas Bruso
Bruso was born in Michigan.
In addition to the "AC Transit Fight", another video involving Thomas Bruso was uploaded to YouTube.
He was stunned with a taser twice at the Oakland Coliseum by police on August 3, 2009, for failing to comply with police officers.
He was charged with resisting arrest and taken to a psychiatric hospital for evaluation.
Interviews of Bruso
Bruso was the subject of several interviews, among those one shot in San Francisco by KRON on February 19, 2010.
Nathan Maas, a graphic designer from Portland, Oregon, produced a documentary short entitled I Am a Motherfucker, in which Bruso is interviewed about his personal background, day-to-day activity, and thoughts on his contemporary celebrity status.
The documentary was uploaded to YouTube.
Michael
The black male, identified only as Michael, was interviewed on the set of San Francisco Bay Area radio talk show Dog House FM on February 22, 2010, where he issued an apology to AC Transit, the people who were present on the bus at the time of the incident, and to Bruso for his role in the fight.
In the interview, he claimed that during the AC Transit event, he was intoxicated, but insisted that he was trying to calm down Bruso on the bus.
Michael also said Bruso's accusations in one interview are not true (that Michael was a convicted murderer on parole;
that Michael brandished a knife at Bruso).
He also said the famous quote, "Bring the ambalamps/amberlamps."
Spread of the meme
Within a short time of the original video "going viral", musical and animated parodies about the fight began to appear on YouTube in a manner similar to the way parodies spread after the "Don't tase me, bro!" University of Florida Taser incident.
The Huffington Post called the AC Transit Bus Fight "the fastest growing public fight meme ever".
Original songs, remixes, animations, "tributes", and other derivative and reflective videos, slide shows, and photo galleries dedicated to the event and its participants were also hosted at newly opened Internet domains with names that derived from aspects of the event.
Typical of the adaptations of the original video that focused on the fight as a form of video game was a Mortal Kombat parody called "Epic Beard Man – Mortal Kombat Style".
The movie Bad Ass inspired by Thomas Bruso, is due to be released in April 2012.
