Theuriau obtained a DUT in News-Communication from the Technical University ( Institut universitaire de technologie, or IUT) Pierre Mendès-France in Grenoble, and later a Master's degree in Audiovisual Journalism from the Institute of Communication and Media (ICM) at Échirolles.

She made her breakthrough as a newscaster and travel show host for LCI, the news channel and for TF1.
Her programs were LCI Matin (LCI Morning), the 6:40 news on LCI and TF1 from Monday to Thursday and the Voyages travel show on Wednesdays at 13:55 on LCI.
In May 2006, she surprised the management of TF1 by refusing the offer to be the anchorwoman of the weekend evening news of TF1, as a summer replacement for sitting anchorwoman Claire Chazal.
M6/ Zone Interdite
In June 2006, Métropole 6, another French television channel, announced her arrival for September as editor-in-chief and presenter of Zone Interdite ("Forbidden Zone"), a weekly magazine show featuring investigative reporting.
She also presents Un jour, une Photo and Deux, trois jours avec moi on the French TV channel Paris Première, in partnership with Paris Match.
Un jour, une photo features stories behind iconic and historic photos.

I am absolutely not seeking this publicity."
