Background
Even had I thought of trying to get my boys to do this I probably couldn't have, neither were coerced into any of this and neither were hurt (for very long anyway).
Howard Davies-Carr, father of the boys
The 56 second long video which was uploaded on YouTube in May 2007 —features two English brothers, Harry Davies-Carr (aged three) and Charlie Davies-Carr (aged one).
The two are seen sitting in a chair when Harry puts his finger into Charlie's mouth and gets bitten.
Harry, who is hurt, says "ouch" repeatedly and his brother begins to giggle.
Afterwards, Harry smiles and says "Charlie bit me".
Howard Davies-Carr, the father of the boys, said the video was "simply an attempt to capture the boys growing up".
While watching the fingerbiting scene on his camera after recording it, it "didn't particularly stand out".
It was not until he transferred the video onto his computer a few weeks later and played it again that he realized it was funny.
The Vancouver Sun said the funniest part of the video is "the face on Charlie who appears as though he knows what he's doing."
The Davies-Carr family lives in England.
Howard uploaded the video onto YouTube so that it could be watched by the boys' godfather, who was residing in the United States.
He chose YouTube because the size of the video file was so big that it could not be sent by email.
Howard commented on the video: "The clip only went up as I wanted to share it with the boys' godfather.
I was naive about the whole YouTube thing.
It became viral and once that happened there was nothing I could do.
People have sent lovely comments and messages and I now upload a new video of the boys every six weeks."

Impact
As a result of the video's success, the boys have gained stardom.
Harry and Charlie have their own blog and video series, and "Charlie Bit My Finger" T-shirts and limited edition calendars have been made.
As of July 2010, more than thirty other clips of Harry and Charlie had been uploaded by their father to YouTube, which have also been seen by millions.
They also feature Jasper, the third child in the family.
Shelley Davies-Carr, the mother, told The Sun in 2010 that "a lot of people like seeing Harry and Charlie growing up and following the family story.
They knew I was pregnant with Jasper and now they're watching him grow up." In the same article Howard noted, however, that he has "deliberately kept away from the personal bits.
You don't see their birthdays, school plays or things like the first time they cycled.
All I do is put up one clip every six weeks and an awful lot happens every six weeks." Howard has stated that he will not continue to upload videos of his children when they grow older.
He said in 2010 that "I don't know if they'll take it over.
I'd like to think they'd have an interest, but it will be their decision." Shelley commented on the success: " Susan Boyle has never had the hits we have had.
The video got on to a college networking site in the US and from there it went viral.
I think the British accents have helped make it so globally viewed." According to a 2008 interview with Shelley, the boys get embarrassed when they see themselves on television.
She also noted that they are "shy about their new fame." Howard commented that his sons "are now almost legendary.
People want their autographs, it's just crazy."
According to the Daily Mail, fan clubs dedicated to Harry and Charlie have been established around the world.
According to The Times, web experts believe the Davies-Carr family could earn £100,000 from "Charlie Bit My Finger", mostly from advertisements shown during the video.
A The Wall Street Journal article by Diana Ransom claims that Howard Davies-Carr "won't say exactly how much his family has earned from the video, but the added income made it more possible to afford a new house, he says." He has said, however, that although "many people have said we should do mugs and keyrings, we have deliberately not commercialised the children.
It's just that we don't want it to change the boys' lives."
In their list of YouTube's 50 greatest viral videos of all time, Time ranked "Charlie Bit My Finger" as number one.
