Denny Hazen, commonly known by his stage name Denny Blaze, The Average Homeboy and Blazin' Hazen, is an American rapper made famous for a demo tape produced in the late 1980s featuring his single "The Average Homeboy".
The video was widely rejected by record labels and allegedly sat within a box at an MTV Studio for 17 years until an employee discovered the video then uploaded it to YouTube.
Subsequently another demo video of his surfaced known as Blazin' Hazen.
Soon, his videos made primetime as they were featured VH1's Web junk and Best Week Ever.
Denny Blaze has since released two albums under his own label, Blazin Productions.
Denny Blaze was also featured on Doogtoons and made an appearance on episode 21 of Tosh.0 which aired on February 10, 2010.
