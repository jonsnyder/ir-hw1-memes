" Music Is My Hot Hot Sex " is a single by Brazilian band Cansei de Ser Sexy from their first album Cansei de Ser Sexy.
The song was featured in a Zune advertisement in 2006 and again in an iPod advertisement in 2007.
An 18-year-old British student, Nick Haley, used the song in a homemade 30-second commercial for the iPod touch that he created and then posted on the video sharing site YouTube on September 11, 2007.
Creative executives from Apple's advertising agency, TBWA\Chiat\Day, saw Haley's creation, contacted him and enlisted him to remake it as a broadcast version.
The spot began airing in the U.S.
on October 28, 2007.
