Keyboard Cat is an Internet meme.
It consists of a video from 1984 of "Fatso", a cat owned by Charlie Schmidt of Spokane, Washington, wearing a blue shirt (belonging to Schmidt's son Cody, who was a baby at the time) and "playing" an upbeat rhythm on an electronic keyboard.
In reality, Fatso, who lived until 1987, was manipulated by Schmidt.
The video of Fatso was posted to YouTube under the title "charlie schmidt's cool cats" in June 2007.
Later, Brad O'Farrell obtained Schmidt's permission to reuse the footage, appending to the end of a blooper video to "play" that person offstage after the mistake or gaffe in a similar manner as getting the hook in the days of vaudeville.
The appending of Schmidt's video to other blooper and other viral videos became popular, with such videos usually accompanied with the title Play Him Off, Keyboard Cat or a variant.
"Keyboard cat" was ranked #2 on Current.TV's list of 50 Greatest Viral Videos.
