Fred Figglehorn (stylized on webpage and on T-shirts as FЯED ) is a fictional character created and portrayed by American actor Lucas Cruikshank.
Fred is a 6-year-old boy, with a high voice, and has a dysfunctional home life and " anger management issues".
Cruikshank, a teenager from Columbus, Nebraska, created the Fred video series for his channel on the video-sharing website YouTube, to center around the Fred character.
Although Cruikshank voices Fred, the audio is digitally altered to sound higher-pitched than Cruikshank's true voice.

History
Cruikshank introduced the Fred character in a video on JKL Productions, a channel he started on YouTube with his cousins, Jon and Katie Smet.
He and his cousins set up the JKL Productions channel on June 11, 2006, and Cruikshank uploaded several videos testing out different characters.
His first Fred video was uploaded on October 30, 2006, and when this character started to become popular, Cruikshank made more videos featuring Fred.
On April 30, 2008, these videos were removed from JKL Productions, and added to the Fred channel.
On May 1 the first official video of the series, titled "Fred on May Day" was released, explaining that Cruikshank asked YouTube for the Fred channel.
Someone else previously owned the channel, which was later turned into one of Fred's enemies in the Fred series.
By April 2009, the channel had over one million subscribers, making it the first YouTube channel to do so, and the most subscribed channel at the time.
However, in August 2009, YouTube celebrities Ryan Higa's and Sean Fujiyoshi's channel, Nigahiga, overtook Fred as the most subscribed channel.
It was the third to reach two million, in September 2010, shortly after falling to third.
As of February 2012, the videos have received over 883 million views, and over 2.3 million are subscribed to the channel.
Cruikshank has made a few television appearances, both as himself, and as Fred.
In December 2009, Cruikshank filmed Fred: The Movie, which aired on Nickelodeon on September 18, 2010.
Nickelodeon has created a franchise surrounding the character and began producing the sequel in March 2011.
Fred 2: Night of the Living Fred aired on October 22, 2011, also on Nickelodeon.
In December 2011, it was announced that Fred: The Show would be produced, consisting of 20 11-minute episodes, and a third movie would air later in 2012.

Fred (stylized on webpages as FЯED ) is an internet video series centering around the dysfunctional 6-year-old Fred Figglehorn, created by Lucas Cruikshank.
Fred lives with his recovering drug-addicted and alcoholic mother, whose voice is often heard, and his grandmother.
It is implied that Fred has been the victim of child abuse (for example being locked in a dog cage for three days), however he frequently speaks of his love for his mother, particularly after her stay at rehab.
Fred's father is mentioned several times as being on death row in the state penitentiary.
Fred has not met his father, as he left Mrs.
Figglehorn while she was still pregnant with Fred.
In seasons one through three, Fred communicates with all characters off-screen.
On screen characters are seen for the first time in a dream sequence, in "Fred: A Star In His Own Mind", Fred dreams of being a famous actor, meeting fan girls and other famous actors.
Season four, as it was filmed after Fred: The Movie, marked a change in production style, it is filmed in a higher video quality, and shows other on-screen characters.
The original production style was revived for a few episodes in 2010, introducing the Cladio character, after the movie was released in the UK, and ended when Cruikshank returned to movie filming.
Leading up to the second movie's release, a new series, called Figgle Chat, was produced, and features internet and television stars.
Following that, an animated series, It's Fred!
, named after Fred's catchphrase, began being uploaded to the channel.
Cruikshank has described the channel as "programming for kids by kids".
The series is intended as a parody of people who, in Cruikshank's words, "think that everyone is so interested in them." Cruikshank believes that viewers either "automatically love Fred or automatically hate Fred, there is no in between".
The videos primarily consist of the character speaking to the audience about what is happening in his life.
Fred has a high-pitched "chipmunk" voice, making him sound more like a 6-year-old.
According to Cruikshank, this effect, and the hyperactive appearance of the character, are achieved by speeding up the audio.
The first season follows Fred attempting to perform a number of activities during the summer, until his mother attends rehab.
"Fred Goes Swimming" is the most watched video on the Fred channel, with over 56 million views.
The second season explores Fred's love for Judy, a girl in his class, and attending school.
There Fred decides to run against class bully Kevin, for class president.
The song "Watch How I Do This", by Kev Blaze, is featured in a number of the season 2 videos.
Season three again follows the daily adventures of Fred, in school, and with classmates, and shows Fred's interest in singing.
The fourth season, now with on-screen characters, shows Fred traveling around town trying out different occupations.
Following this, Fred holds contests surrounding his two movies, gets a visit from a creeping character named Cladio, gets invited to host a talk show, dispels rumours of being owned by Nickelodeon, and becomes animated.
The series uses a floating timeline, that is, it is always taking place in the current year, meaning that Fred is perpetually 6 years old, and in kindergarten.
Filmography
This is a list of videos uploaded to the Fred channel.
60 videos are considered part of the original Fred series, however no official list exists.
The YouTube show feature lists 49 episodes, numbered 1 to 47, spilt into four seasons, while a playlist, linked to from the Fred channel, named Classic FRED!!!
, contains 18 videos ranging from 2007 to 2010.
Since the apparent end of the Fred series in early 2011, two series' have been produced and uploaded, a six episode arc titled Figgle Chat, where Fred interviews internet and television stars, and an animated series titled It's FRED!
, which shows Fred attend school, and the previously off-screen characters.
Eight music videos are also listed here.
