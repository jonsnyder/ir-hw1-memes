The song was first performed in 2001 by "General" Larry Platt in the streets of Atlanta during many campaigns for city elected officials across the city of Atlanta and professionally recorded as early as 2002.
The "General" is also known for performing the song publicly in events and functions around the city of Atlanta including a live performance at the Sweet Auburn Heritage Festival in October 2009 and Centennial Olympic Park in 2008.
Platt was encouraged to perform the song during the American Idol (season 9) auditions by civil rights activist Sally Harley.
After performing the song, it gained popularity as a viral hit.
Platt's former manager Jason Mills released the studio version of the song, without Platt's consent.
The single version of the song was released though unauthorized by Mr.
Larry Platt BMI on February 4, 2010 by American King Music for MP3 download where the song has reportedly sold more than 260,000 downloads.
Mr.
Platt has been offered deals by several labels including Melee Entertainment, Jake Records and others have also entered negotiations with Larry Platt to produce a single of the hit song, but due to the unauthorized distribution of the song by American King Music it has been difficult to navigate.
It was reported that Platt's former manager Jason Mills intended to promote the song servicing radio stations to gain exposure, which is a common music industry practice.
Mr.
Platt has since secured new management under a firm based in Atlanta headed up by Mr.
Earl Little.
