Background
Randall stated that he chose to redub the National Geographic footage because "this animal eats King Cobras, demolishes animals, and this narrator that is so boring, so I said,'we need to spice this thing up.'" Randall has stated that he first gained an interest in animals by way of his father, a cameraman for Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.
While not much information has been officially released about the narrator, the New York Observer has claimed that a press release for a potential television show based around the video reveals Randall as "Christopher Gordon".
Gordon's twitter channel, however, lists him as Randall's assistant.
Critical response
The video received much attention in early 2011, garnering over 32 million views since its release.
References to the video have appeared in Top Gear, American Pickers, and Glee.
The video has been listed as a favorite by Taylor Swift and Olivia Wilde.
Spin offs
Since its release, there has been a book entitled Honey Badger Don't Care released by Andrews McMeel Publishing, as well as talks about a potential television show.
Randall has also voiced several commercials for products such as pistachios and virtual phone systems.
There are also plans to release two apps for iOS and Android, a "a honey badger role-playing game (narrated by Randall)" as well as an app containing phrases and jokes by Randall.
Honey Badger Don't Care
In January 2012 Andrews McMeel Publishing released a book featuring comedic commentaries about the honey badger and ten other animals of the wild kingdom.
Reception to the book has been mixed to positive, with Audubon Magazine writing that the book was "memorable".
The Williamette Week called the book "amusing, but much of the humor of the video is lost without Randallâ€™s narration".
Television show
Randall has confirmed that he is currently developing a television show with Six Eleven Media inspired by the honey badger video entitled Honey Badger U.
Randall has also stated Harland Williams will be active in the project and that the show will be a mixture of live action and animation.
