Internet remixes
Piane has also achieved Internet fame for his satirical celebrity techno remixes.
Published under his online name RevoLucian, Piane has released remixes featuring Barbra Streisand, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, political commentator Bill O'Reilly, and Andrew Meyer, who received national media attention when he was tasered by police during a speech given by U.S.
Senator John Kerry at the University of Florida.
Piane has described his remixes as "just a hobby." His remix of Streisand's 2006 outburst was described as a "dance-tastic song" by Maxine Shen and Raakhee Mirchandani of the New York Post who highlighted it on their hot list of "What We're Obsessed With This Week".
Louis Bayard of Salon highlighted Piane's remix of the O'Reilly outburst made public in 2008, in their "Critics' Picks" column.
Piane attracted particularly strong attention for " Bale Out " a three-minute-long techno remix featuring audio clips from a profanity-laced tirade actor Christian Bale delivered to cinematographer Shane Hurlbut on the set of Terminator Salvation.
Piane made the song shortly after Bale attracted national media attention in February 2009, and "Bale Out" became so popular it attracted media attention itself.
He initially heard the audio of Bale while working on an album for RuPaul.
The song was posted on the websites MySpace and YouTube on February 2, 2009, and received over 200,000 views within one day.
By February 4, 2009, it had received 700,000 views.
Regarding the song, Piane said, "I think most people are enjoying it.
I don't know if Christian Bale is enjoying it, but I hope he does.
I think I've taken something that maybe made him look really bad and turned it into something that all these people are enjoying." In an interview with E!: Entertainment Television, Christian Bale said of the song, "It was a good remix.
They did a good job." After receiving a remix of his outburst from a friend, Bale said, "They did a bloody good job!
I've gotta say, what a great impulse, you know?
To take something ugly like that and make it into a dance?
That's a wonderful thing." McG, the director of Terminator Salvation, has also praised "Bale Out" and has a copy of the song on his iPod.
