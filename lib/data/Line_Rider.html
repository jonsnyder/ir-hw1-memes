It was originally created in September 2006 by Boštjan Čadež (also known as "fsk"), a Slovenian student.
Originally appearing on DeviantArt on September 23, 2006, Line Rider quickly became an internet phenomenon.
Line Rider is featured by several websites, such as Yahoo!
but is mainly used on the website Linerider.com, Time Magazine's website and has appeared in several McDonald's commercials for the Snack Wrap in 2008.
Line Rider was also selected by staff and voted by users as the Best Webtoy of 2006 in the Jay is Games polls.

Gameplay
The Line Rider character, "Bosh"
The basic concept is to draw one or more lines with the mouse on which a boy (referred to as "Dude" by the creator ) on a sled can ride after the player presses the "Play" button.
The game includes simulated physics, which means the track must be sufficiently smooth to prevent the character from falling off the sled.
The author has said that he prefers the description "toy" to "game," as there is no goal to accomplish, nor does it have an end.
In spite of its simplicity, many complicated tracks have been created, which include loops and other stunts.
New tracks can consist of unrealistic tricks such as "flings" and "manuals" both on and off the sled.
Some tracks are even set to music and include hand-mountain slopes and trees.
Tracks are typically shared among users by uploading a video to web sites, such as YouTube or Google Video.
Revision 6.2 of Line Rider was released in August 2007, and was optimized to run more smoothly, and to have a higher-powered zoom tool.
The game does allow created tracks to be saved, and shown to the public (only if creator wishes to do so).
The storage is not on the Line Rider website, but on the user's hard drive, therefore allowing maximum storage implication and quicker access to stored tracks.
In order to allow public viewing, the user must be logged into the website server.
On July 1, 2008, the original Flash version was replaced by a new one written in Silverlight.
It includes a new feature that allows people to send tracks to other people via Windows Messenger.
On October 23, 2009, this was replaced by Beta 3, which has the option to use dual players, a camera, trapdoor and deceleration lines.
IP acquisition
On December 20, 2006 inXile Entertainment announced that it acquired console rights to Line Rider.
The game was redesigned for the Wii, DS and iPhone platforms, in addition to the standard free play mode, the games featured a story and puzzle modes.
All of the art work and sounds have also been redone.
Mobile version
Line Rider was released for portable devices in October 2008.
The gameplay is similar to that of the original revision 6.2, with the addition of a multiplayer puzzle mode, and has several added features including different vehicles, exploding lines and scenery.
Players are able to share tracks with others through a Bluetooth connection and can send the files in texts to other phones and to the web.
A version has been released for the Apple iPhone called Line Rider iRide.
This version includes iPhone specific features such as accelerometer based physics and worldwide file sharing.
As an educational tool
Line Rider has been the basis for an article published in The Physics Teacher magazine concerning the use of computers in Physics education by members of the Physics Department of Southeastern Louisiana University.
The article uses video captures of Line Rider to explore the physics in the game by use of video analysis.
