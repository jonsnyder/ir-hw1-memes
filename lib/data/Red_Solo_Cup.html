"Red Solo Cup" is about the Solo Cup Company's red style of plastic cups, and their common usage at parties, among other occasions.
It is in the key of A major, with a primary chord pattern of A-Bm7-E-A on the verses, which are spoken-word.
History
Singer-songwriter duo The Warren Brothers co-wrote "Red Solo Cup" with Brett Beavers and his brother, Jim Beavers.
The four of them formed a group they called The Warren Beavers, and decided to write something that would "make us all laugh and smile." According to Brett Warren, Jim Beavers did the majority of the writing.
Keith told CMT that it was "the stupidest song that I have ever heard in my life" but also "freakin' awesome."
Critical reception
Giving it four stars out of five, Taste of Country writer Billy Dukes said, "It works because Keith makes no effort to pretend this is anything but a simple and stupid ditty."
On December 6, 2011, the song was performed on the TV show Glee by Chord Overstreet and members of New Directions.
Music video
The music video includes cameos from Jeff Dunham, Carrot Top, Ted Nugent, Sammy Hagar, Craig Ferguson, Geoff Peterson, Roger Clemens, Eric Church, Joe Nichols, Lance Burton and Larry Bird among others.
It has become a viral video on YouTube, with more than 600,000 views before the album's release.
The video surpassed 12 million views in February 2012.
