The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny, often shortened to The Ultimate Showdown, is a comical song and video released on December 7, 2005.
The song was written and performed by Neil Cicierega under the pseudonym "Lemon Demon", with art and Flash animation by Shawn Vulliez.
The Ultimate Showdown is a massive, city-wide battle set in Tokyo started by Godzilla and Batman ultimately involving dozens of pop-culture icons, fictional and otherwise, ending with Fred Rogers emerging victorious and then committing seppuku.
It gained a large cult following among web enthusiasts and became the "user's choice" on December 28, 2005 on Newgrounds where it has been viewed over 12 million times.
It appeared on several other websites including Albino Blacksheep, YouTube, Transbuddha, and Weebl's Stuff.
As of October 2011, it had over 8 million views on YouTube.
The song topped the "Funny Five" on The Dr.
Demento Show for several weeks and was the #1 Request for 2006.
The video has since been parodied and referenced repeatedly in other flash videos.
A new version of the song was later recorded specifically for the Rock Band Network and was released for the service on July 6, 2010 under the title The Ultimate Showdown (RBN Mix).
It has recently been redone live by the full band for Lemon Demon's new album, "Live (Only Not)".
