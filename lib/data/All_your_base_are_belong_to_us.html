" All your base are belong to us " (often shortened to " All Your Base ", " AYBABTU ", or simply " AYB ") is a broken English phrase that is an Internet phenomenon or meme.
The text comes from the opening cutscene of the 1991 European Sega Mega Drive version of the video game Zero Wing by Toaplan, which was poorly translated from Japanese.
The meme developed from this as the result of a GIF animation depicting the opening text which was initially popularized on the Something Awful message forums, leading to a phenomenon of surreal altered images depicting the meme in everyday scenes, placement of the text in real world locations, and the text and images being set to hardcore techno music by the band The Laziest Men on Mars.
Other Zero Wing phrases, including "For great justice!" and "Move zig!", popularized in the same animated GIF and video, also acquired some degree of notoriety and popular re-use within internet culture.
