The song was performed by The Muppets characters in 2009.
The cover is perhaps best known for its music video, which was originally posted on YouTube on November 23, 2009 before the release of the track.
The video features multiple Muppets characters singing partially modified lyrics of the original song and garnered over seven million hits within its first week of release.
The video and song is an official production of The Muppets Studio.
The success of the video caused Walt Disney Records to release the cover as a single on December 13, 2009, where it peaked at #32 on the UK Singles Chart.
Video
The Muppets' version of "Bohemian Rhapsody" was directed by Kirk Thatcher, who has been involved with several other Muppets videos.
According to studio manager Lylle Breier, the idea of the Muppets singing "Bohemian Rhapsody" had long been an idea that they wanted to do, but only was able to bring the project together within a short time before the video's release.
Thatcher noted they had a long list of possible songs they wanted to do with a large group of Muppets, including Don McLean's " American Pie ", but "Bohemian Rhapsody" was their ultimate selection.
Filming was completed within a day by 20 staffers;
Thatcher considered the task to be "epic in scale" considering they normally only use half a dozen Muppets for a single scene.
Breier stated that this and other videos that the studio has released to YouTube are part of a promotional push for the Muppets;
Breier likened outlets on the Internet like YouTube to the variety shows of the 1970s, and felt that the Muppets easily fitted into that culture.
The video is a montage by about 70 different Muppets characters singing their part of the lyrics against a black screen, in the same style used by Queen for portions of their promotion video of the song and mimicking the four-person layout used for the cover of Queen's second album.
After completing the song, which ends up with mosaic of all the characters singing, it is revealed that this was one side of a computer video conference with Kermit the Frog, who laments his decision for that type of meeting to Scooter.
The video presents a shorter version of Queen's song with some lyric alterations to retain appropriateness of the characters for a younger audience.
For example within the first stanza of the ballad portion of the song, the lyrics where the singer laments to his mother that he "just killed a man" are replaced by Animal calling out repeatedly for "mama".
Other aspects of the lyrics are changed for humorous purposes surrounding the Muppets characters.
Pepe the King Prawn starts the opera portion of the song stating that he sees "a little silhouetto of a clam".
The back-and-forth lyrics, "Bismillah!
No!
We will not let you go...let him go!", are replaced with Fozzie the Bear begging "Let me joke" to Statler and Waldorf, who state "We do not like your jokes".
The line "Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me" is replaced with the remaining muppets who have not been in the video singing "Does anyone know if there is a part for me?" The song ends with Miss Piggy, lounging on Rowlf the Dog's piano, singing "Nothing really matters but moi !"
The video premiered on YouTube on November 23, 2009.
Within a week, the video had accrued over 7 million views, and has nearly 15 million views within the following five months.
The video was nominated and won the "Viral Video" category in the 14th Annual Webby Awards.
The popularity of the video led to the song being distributed through digital download on iTunes in December by Walt Disney Records and EMI.
The song reached #32 on the UK Singles Chart for the week of December 26, 2009.
For New Year's Eve at Disneyland, the video was projected onto the Fantasmic!
mist screens in-between performances, and in place of an extra midnight performance.
This "random act of Disney" also utilized the show's various laser effects and lighting towers working in tandem with the video.
