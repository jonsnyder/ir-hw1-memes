Boom goes the dynamite is the nickname given to a college sportscast at Ball State University in March 2005 that became an internet sensation.
Covering the March 22, 2005 NBA game between the Indiana Pacers and the New Jersey Nets, sportscaster Brian Collins monotonously says the phrase "boom goes the dynamite" as Indiana Pacer shooting guard Fred Jones nails a 3-pointer with 2:03 left in the first quarter.
Collins goes on to incorrectly give the final score as Pacers 63 - Nets 61 (which was the score with 3:42 remaining in the third quarter);
the final score was actually Nets 98 - Pacers 91.
During his freshman year, Collins agreed to fill in for the regular sportscaster who was ill, on Ball State University's campus newscast.
The teleprompter was operational, but an inexperienced operator accidentally fast-forwarded through the script, leaving Collins with only an occasional few words to use.
Eventually posted on YouTube, the newscast is now known as "the Collins incident" in communications classes.
Collins' sportscast was also featured on television and radio throughout the country and earned him an appearance on The Late Show (hosted by Ball State alumnus David Letterman ).
A trademark application on the phrase was filed but ultimately abandoned by a San Diego-based speculator who offered it on t-shirts, saying that part of the proceeds would go to a scholarship fund at Ball State for journalism students.
ESPN SportsCenter anchor Scott Van Pelt sent Collins words of encouragement and paid homage to him using the "boom" catchphrase on the air several times.
In 2009, the Fox Sports program Best Damn Sports Show Period called the clip the #1 biggest "sports blooper" in all of televised sports reporting history.
Collins, among other internet stars, is set to star in the upcoming film The Chronicles of Rick Roll.
