" Nek minnit " (" next minute ";
alternatively " negg minute ") is an internet meme originating from New Zealand skateboarder Levi Hawken.
Hawken appeared in a viral video which shows his scooter, apparently destroyed outside a dairy.
In the video, Hawken says, "Left my scooter outside the dairy.
Nek minnit", and the destroyed scooter is shown.
The "nek minnit" video spawned many parodies.
The video
Levi Hawken is a Dunedin, New Zealand skateboarder who suffers from ectodermal dysplasia, which abnormalised his hair and teeth, and brought about bullying as a child.
In the "nek minute" video, Hawken appears shirtless with a shaven head;
his missing teeth have also been noted by many viewers.
The video takes place in a Fairfield, Otago skatepark;
Hawken announces, "Left my scooter outside the dairy.
Nek minnit." The camera then tilts to show Hawken's broken scooter.
The nine second-long clip was recorded for South in Your Mouth, an independent skate film by Colin Evans, Hawken's friend;
however, the "nek minute" video was uploaded separately.
The video was popularised in mid-2011, and was viewed on YouTube 600,000 times by late September 2011;
at December 2011, the video had received over 1.5 million views.
The phrase "nek minute" was the sixth most searched term in New Zealand on internet search engine Google in 2011, and was voted the runner-up in the 2011 "Word of the Year" poll by website Public Address.
Parodies
The phrase "nek minnit" has been parodied by many people and organisations.

During the New Zealand general election, 2011 campaign, the Conservative Party had billboards with "Nek minnit, Conservatives" written on them.
