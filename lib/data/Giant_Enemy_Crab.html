Giant Enemy Crab is an Internet meme created in video game forums in 2006.
It achieved notable popularity in the gaming press and was also referenced by video game developers.
History
The meme originated during the demonstration of Genji: Days of the Blade at the Sony E3 2006 press conference.
The producer Bill Ritch claimed that Genji 2' s epic battles were based on "famous battles which actually took place in ancient Japan." Almost immediately after this was spoken, the gameplay footage showed a boss battle against, in his own words, a "giant enemy crab." Popular memes originating from the Genji demonstration included the game features described such as "you attack its weak point for massive damage" and "real-time...weapon change," despite neither of these being at all new to video gaming, being staples of classic 1980s games such as Metroid.
In IGN's E3 2006 wrap-up, they listed a number of Genji 2 quotes.
