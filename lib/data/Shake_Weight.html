Product specifications
The Shake Weight has a female and male version, though was initially released as a product "designed specifically for women".
The female version weighs 2.5 lbs.
Per official company press releases, "Based on a groundbreaking workout technology called Dynamic Inertia, which engages the muscles in the arms, shoulders and chest in an entirely new fashion, the Shake Weight increases upper body muscle activity by more than 300% compared to traditional free weights".
The company website further adds that the product has "scientifically proven results" and that the user can "get incredible results in just six minutes a day, sixty-five days a year".
In comparison, the male version weighs twice as much at 5 lbs.
The product appears to be based on "vibration plate technology—machines that vibrate to make the muscles relax and contract several times a second—thought to enhance the impact of exercise".
In practice, once the user starts moving the dumbbell, it creates a vibrating effect to work out muscles.
This action "is supposed to tone upper biceps, triceps and shoulders".
Fitness IQ, the manufacturers of the Shake Weight, released a study of the male version of the Shake Weight which allegedly shows how it produces a higher quality workout than regular weight lifting.
