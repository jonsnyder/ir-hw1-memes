The clip became widely known through uploads on YouTube and CollegeHumor on June 19, 2007.
An earlier and identical version, titled as Dramatic Look, had been uploaded to YouTube on June 6, 2007.
The clip of the prairie dog is from the Japanese television show Hello!
Morning featuring Minimoni.
The clip has a prairie dog inside a transparent box being shown to the hosts in the studio.
CollegeHumor also released a longer clip under the title Undramatic Chipmunk, showing how the video looked in the original Japanese version.
The audio used in Dramatic Chipmunk is taken from the score of the 1974 Mel Brooks film Young Frankenstein, which was composed by two-time Oscar nominee (and longtime Brooks collaborator) John Morris, and orchestrated by Morris and EGOT recipient Jonathan Tunick.
It uses three dramatic chords (A minor, C# minor, and E minor) performed in full orchestral tutti, and has a rumble of thunder in the background.
The "chipmunk" turns its head and stares at the camera while the music is played.
Popularity
Since its release, the video has received over thirty million of views.
People Magazine named the Dramatic Chipmunk as one of The 10 Wildest YouTube Stars of 2007.
