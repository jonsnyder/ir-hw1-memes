Origin
The twelve days in the song are the twelve days starting Christmas Day, or in some traditions, the day after Christmas (December 26) (Boxing Day or St.
Stephen's Day, as being the feast day of St.
Stephen Protomartyr) to the day before Epiphany, or the Feast of the Epiphany (January 6, or the Twelfth Day).
Twelfth Night is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as "the evening of the fifth of January, preceding Twelfth Day, the eve of the Epiphany, formerly the last day of the Christmas festivities and observed as a time of merrymaking."
Although the specific origins of the chant are not known, it possibly began as a Twelfth Night "memories-and-forfeits" game, in which a leader recited a verse, each of the players repeated the verse, the leader added another verse, and so on until one of the players made a mistake, with the player who erred having to pay a penalty, such as offering up a kiss or a sweet.
This is how the game is offered up in its earliest known printed version, in the children's book Mirth without Mischief (c.
1780) published in England, which 100 years later Lady Gomme, a collector of folktales and rhymes, described playing every Twelfth Day night before eating mince pies and twelfth cake.
The song apparently is older than the printed version, though it is not known how much older.
Textual evidence indicates that the song was not English in origin, but French, though it is considered an English carol.
Three French versions of the song are known.
If the "partridge in a pear tree" of the English version is to be taken literally, then it seems as if the chant comes from France, since the red-legged (or French) partridge, which perches in trees more frequently than the native common (or grey) partridge, was not successfully introduced into England until about 1770.
The song was imported to the United States in 1910 by Emily Brown, of the Downer Teacher's College in Milwaukee, WI, who had encountered the song in an English music store sometime before.
She needed the song for the school Christmas pageant, an annual extravaganza that she was known for organizing.
Lyrics
"The Twelve Days of Christmas" is a cumulative song, meaning that each verse is built on top of the previous verses.
There are twelve verses, each describing a gift given by "my true love" on one of the twelve days of Christmas.
The first verse runs:
On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me...
A Partridge in a Pear Tree.
The second verse:
On the second day of Christmas, my true love gave to me...
2 Turtle Doves
And a Partridge in a Pear Tree.
The third verse begins to show some metrical variance, as explained below:
On the third day of Christmas, my true love gave to me...
3 French Hens
2 Turtle Doves
And a Partridge in a Pear Tree.
...and so forth, until the last verse:
On the twelfth day of Christmas, my true love gave to me...
12 Drummers Drumming
11 Pipers Piping
10 Lords -a- Leaping
9 Ladies Dancing
8 Maids-a-Milking
7 Swans -a- Swimming
6 Geese -a- Laying
5 Gold Rings
4 Colly Birds
3 French Hens
2 Turtle Doves
And a Partridge in a Pear Tree.
This version features variant lyrics, as explained below.
The time signature of this song is not constant, unlike most popular music.
This irregular meter perhaps speaks for the song's folk origin.
The introductory lines, such as "On the twelfth day of Christmas, my true love gave to me", are made up of two 4/4 bars, while most of the lines naming gifts receive one 3/4 bar per gift with the exception of "Five gold(en) rings," which receives two 4/4 bars, "Two turtle doves" getting a 4/4 bar with "And a" on its 4th beat and "Partridge in a pear tree" getting two 4/4 bars of music.
In most versions, a 4/4 bar of music immediately follows "Partridge in a pear tree." "On the" is found in that bar on the 4th (pickup) beat for the next verse.
The successive bars of 3 for the gifts surrounded by bars of 4 give the song its hallmark "hurried" quality.
The second to fourth verses' melody is different from that of the fifth to twelfth verses.
Before the fifth verse (when "five gold(en) rings" is first sung), the melody, using solfege, is "sol re mi fa re" for the fourth to second items, and this same melody is thereafter sung for the twelfth to sixth items.
However, the melody for "four colly birds, three French hens, two turtle doves" changes from this point, differing from the way these lines were sung in the opening four verses.
Variations
There are many variations of this song in which the last four objects are arranged in a different order (for example—twelve lords a-leaping, eleven ladies (or dames a-) dancing, ten pipers piping, nine drummers drumming).
At least one version has "ten fiddlers fiddling," and another has "nine ladies waiting." Still another version alters the fourth gift to "four mockingbirds."
The earliest attested version of the chant in England appears in The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes, as follows:
The twelfth day of Christmas, | My true love sent to me | Twelve lords a-leaping, | Eleven pipers piping, | Ten ladies dancing, | Nine drummers drumming, | Eight maids a-milking, | Seven swans a-swimming, | Six geese a-laying, | Five gold rings, | Four colly birds, | Three French hens, | Two turtle doves, and | A partridge in a pear tree.
There are some regional variants of the verb in the opening line of each verse.
In the United States the true love sometimes "gave" the gifts to the singer.
In the British version, the true love "sent" the gifts to the singer, but "said" is also found (for example as sung by Kate Rusby ).
It has been suggested by a number of sources over the years that the pear tree is in fact supposed to be perdrix, French for partridge and pronounced per-dree, and was simply copied down incorrectly when the oral version of the game was transcribed.
The original line would have been: "A partridge, une perdrix."
Some variations have crept into the English-language version over the years.
The fourth day's gift is often stated as four "calling" birds but in the earliest attested version was transcribed as four "colly" birds, this being a word for a blackbird.
The fifth day's gift of gold rings refers not to jewelry but to ring-necked birds such as the ring-necked pheasant;
or to "five goldspinks"—a goldspink being an old name for a Goldfinch.
When these variations are re-analyzed, the pattern of the first seven gifts all being birds is restored.
There is a version of "The Twelve Days of Christmas" that is still sung in Sussex in which the four calling birds are replaced by canaries.
A minor variant includes the singing of "golden" rather than "gold" rings, to avoid having to stretch "gold" into two syllables ("go-old").
France
In the west of France the piece is known as a song, "La Foi de la loi," and is sung "avec solennité," the sequence being: a good stuffing without bones, two breasts of veal, three joints of beef, four pigs' trotters, five legs of mutton, six partridges with cabbage, seven spitted rabbits, eight plates of salad, nine dishes for a chapter of canons, ten full casks, eleven beautiful full-breasted maidens, and twelve musketeers with their swords.
Scotland
In Scotland, early in the 19th century, the recitation began: "The king sent his lady on the first Yule day, | A popingo-aye;
| Wha learns my carol and carries it away?" The succeeding gifts were two partridges, three plovers, a goose that was grey, three starlings, three goldspinks, a bull that was brown, three ducks a-merry laying, three swans a-merry swimming, an Arabian baboon, three hinds a-merry hunting, three maids a-merry dancing, three stalks o' merry corn.
Australia
In Australia, the most common version is the traditional English version.
However, a number of alternative versions have been created, all of which replace the traditional gifts with native Australian animals.

Music
In the nineteenth century, most sources for the lyrics do not include music, and those that do often include music different from what has become the standard melody.
Cecil Sharp's Folk Songs from Somerset (1905) contains two different melodies for the song, both distinct from the now-standard melody.
In 1909, English composer Frederic Austin wrote an arrangement in which he added his melody from "Five gold rings" onwards, which has since become standard.
Austin's was also one of the earliest, and possibly the earliest, to substitute "Four calling birds" for the earlier "Colly birds".
The copyright to this arrangement was registered in 1909 and is still active by its owners, Novello &amp;
Co.
Limited.
This is one of many alternative melodies to "The Twelve Days" published in the nineteenth centry.
It was "collected by the late Mr.
John Bell, of Gateshead, about eighty years ago"
Meaning
The lyrics of The Twelve Days of Christmas may have no meaning at all.
Its meaning, if it has any, has yet to be satisfactorily explained.
According to The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes, "Suggestions have been made that the gifts have significance, as representing the food or sport for each month of the year.
Importance long been attached to the Twelve Days, when, for instance, the weather on each day was carefully observed to see what it would be in the corresponding month of the coming year.
Nevertheless, whatever the ultimate origin of the chant, it seems probable the lines that survive today both in England and France are merely an irreligious travesty."
A bit of modern folklore claims that the song's lyrics were written as a " catechism song" to help young Catholics learn their faith, at a time when practising Catholicism was criminalized in England (1558 until 1829).
There is no primary evidence supporting this claim, and no evidence that the claim is historical, or "anything but a fanciful modern day speculation." The theory is of relatively recent origin.
It was first suggested by Canadian English teacher and hymnologist Hugh D.
McKellar in a short article, "How to Decode the Twelve Days of Christmas," published in 1979.
In a later article published in the music journal The Hymn, he reiterates that the associations are his.
The idea was further popularized by a Catholic priest, Fr.
Hal Stockert, in an article he wrote in 1982 and posted online in 1995.
Variations in lyrics provide further evidence against the "catechism song" origin.
For example, the four Gospels are often described as the "four calling birds," when in fact the phrase "calling birds" is a modern (probably 20th century) phonetic reinterpretation of "colly birds" (blackbirds).
Regardless of the origin of this idea, a number of Christians give the following meanings to the gifts:
"The Twelve Days of Christmas" as a Catechism Song
Gift
Interpretation
A partridge in a pear tree
Jesus
Two turtle doves
The Old and New Testaments
Three French hens
The three kings bearing gifts
Four calling birds
The four Gospels
Five gold rings
The Torah or Pentateuch, the first five books of the Old Testament
Six geese a-laying
The six days of Creation
Seven swans a-swimming
Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit
Eight maids a-milking
The eight Beatitudes
Nine ladies dancing
Nine fruits of the Holy Spirit
Ten lords a-leaping
The Ten Commandments
Eleven pipers piping
The eleven faithful Apostles
Twelve drummers drumming
The twelve points of the Apostles' Creed
Christmas Price Index
Main article: Christmas Price Index
Since 1984, the cumulative costs of the items mentioned in the song have been used as a tongue-in-cheek economic indicator.
This custom began with and is maintained by PNC Bank.
Two pricing charts are created, referred to as the Christmas Price Index and The True Cost of Christmas.
The former is an index of the current costs of one set of each of the gifts given by the True Love to the singer of the song "The Twelve Days of Christmas." The latter is the cumulative cost of all the gifts with the repetitions listed in the song.
The people mentioned in the song are hired, not purchased.
The total costs of all goods and services for the 2011 Christmas Price Index is $24,263.18.
The original 1984 cost was $12,623.10.
It has been criticized for not accurately reflecting the true cost of the gifts featured in the Christmas carol.

On the Twelfth Day...
(1955)—also known as On the Twelfth Day of Christmas (US video box title)—is a short film (23 minutes) from the UK, in which a proper Edwardian lady (Miss Tilly, portrayed by Wendy Toye, who also directed the film) patiently endures the ever-increasing disruption to her quiet household when her true love (Truelove, portrayed by David O’Brien) sends her all the items from the song, "The Twelve Days of Christmas."

Green Chri$tma$ is a piece of audio theater written and performed by Stan Freberg and Daws Butler and released by Capitol Records in 1958 (catalog number F 4097).
Mr.
Scrooge (Freberg), the head of an unnamed advertising agency, has gathered a group of clients to discuss tying their products into Christmas.
One attendee, Bob Cratchit (Butler), wants to resist tying his spice company into Christmas, preferring to send Christmas cards with a simple message of "Peace on Earth." Scrooge extols the virtues of making money off of Christmas, and Cratchit counters by reminding Scrooge "whose birthday we're celebrating." The piece is a scathing indictment of the commercialization of Christmas, with references to Christmas-themed advertising by Coca-Cola and Marlboro cigarettes, among others.
The names of the characters are taken from A Christmas Carol in Prose by Charles Dickens, as is one of the products "advertised" ("Tyn-E-Tim Chestnuts").
Green Chri$tma$ also contains a parody of "The Twelve Days of Christmas".
At Brown University a Latin Carol Service, held completely in Latin, is sponsored by the Classics Department each December.
At this event, the women's a capella singing group The Chattertocks of Brown University sing "The Twelve Days of Christmas" entirely in Latin.

To win her heart, he has squire Hollyberry (voiced by Phil Hartman ) steal what he thinks is her Christmas list, but are actually the answers to the King's crossword puzzle.
Sir Carolboomer enlists his squire, Hollyberry, to find every item on her list, including a partridge in a pear tree, eight maids a-milking, four calling birds, and so forth.
Each day, the gloomy Princess Silverbell would chase Hollyberry away.
After twelve days of gift-giving, the princess finally smiles when she sees twelve lords a leaping and falls in love, not with Sir Carolboomer, but with the one who actually did the work, Hollyberry.
Adapted from a story by Romeo Muller.

The stories include a horror-story retelling of "The Twelve Days of Christmas," depicting only days 1–6, primarily featuring birds, who become such a nuisance that the singer decides, after six geese a-laying, to kill all the birds and later eat them for dinner, to the horror of two of the children and the hungry delight of the third.
Episode 11 in the first season of the TV Series Scrubs (TV Series), a parody version of the song was played, featuring emergency department situations instead of gifts.
The scene depicts the character Christopher Turk's declining Christmas spirit due to the increasing amount of accidents during the holiday season, whereas the parodic version of "The Twelve Days of Christmas", presents the most common illnesses on Christmas.
2002
In an episode of Comedy Central's animated television series South Park, " Red Sleigh Down " (Episode 96, first aired on 12 December 2002), Jimmy performs the song at the annual tree-lighting ceremony.
Due to his stutter, it takes him all episode to finish the song.
As part of Nickelodeon's Christmas promotional spots parodying classic Christmas specials, one segment, The 12 Days of Nickmas, featured a parody of the song being sung by characters from the channel's animated series, including SpongeBob SquarePants, The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, The Wild Thornberrys, As Told By Ginger, The Fairly OddParents, Rocket Power, and Hey Arnold!
2003
Who Is Stealing the Twelve Days of Christmas?
by Martha Freeman (Holiday House, 2003) was inspired by the song.
Every Christmas since Alex can remember, his family and neighbors have filled their front yards with decorations from each of the twelve days mentioned in the song "The Twelve Days of Christmas," but this year someone is stealing them one by one.
Relient K's Deck the Halls, Bruise Your Hand, featuring the song "12 Days of Christmas" was released, later reaching No.
60 on the iTunes Top 100 Chart in 2006.
2004
The Twelve Days of Christmas Eve (TV 2004) was a made-for-TV movie in which Calvin Carter (played by Steven Weber ) is a successful business executive who has it all, but neglects those closest to him.
On Christmas Eve, all that changes when the sign on his office building falls on him.
He awakens in a hospital bed, attended by Angie (played by Molly Shannon ), an angel in the guise of a nurse, who informs him he has twelve days—that is, twelve chances—to get his act together and achieve the "perfect" Christmas Eve, else there will be dire consequences.
This movie is a mix of "The Twelve Days of Christmas" (song), Groundhog Day (film), and A Christmas Carol.
In a broadcast of A Prairie Home Companion, The Twelve Days of Christmas was performed by Garrison Keillor and Tom Keith with Keillor singing the lyrics but with Keith providing sound effects for all of the gifts but the five golden rings (which was sung traditionally by a choir and by the audience).
LoadingReadyRun (LRR) released the video, 2004 Holiday Special, which featured "The Twelve Geeky Days of Christmas," as sung by the LRR crew, in which the gifts relate to computers and video games.
This parody was written by Graham Stark and Paul Saunders.
2005
The First Day of Winter by Denise Fleming (Henry Holt &amp;
Co., 2005) is a picture book narrated by a snowman, who receives all sorts of wintry necessities for the first ten days of winter, beginning on December 21.
It was named a Kirkus Reviews Best Children's Book for 2005.
In her act, Las Vegas entertainer Fay McKay performed "The Twelve Daze of Christmas," with the conventional partridge on the first day, and then a different strong alcoholic drink for nearly all the other days: two Cutty Sarks, three Old Crows, four Old Fitzgeralds, etc.
She started the song sounding sober and ending up sounding extremely inebriated and disoriented.
McKay performed this parody of "The Twelve Days of Christmas" throughout her career, which began in 1951, but it was not until 2005 that a film of her performing the song was first released as part of the documentary, Lost Vegas: The Lounge Era.
2006
Twisted Sister made a parody named "Heavy Metal Christmas" in their album A Twisted Christmas.
2007
A YouTube viral video of "The Twelve Days of Christmas" by the undergraduate a cappella group Straight No Chaser included the group's failure to be able to count the 12 days, and interspersed snippets of other traditional Christmas songs, as well as " I Have a Little Dreidel " and Toto's "Africa." This, in turn, was a rearrangement based on Richard Gregory's 1968 arrangement of the song.
2008
"12 Days of Christmas Sing Along" (DVD 2008) was released by DreamWorks as a bonus feature extra on the Shrek the Halls DVD (released on 4 November 2008).
( Shrek the Halls premiered on ABC on 28 November 2007 as an animated TV special.) The short film employs footage from The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper.
A program hosted by Tom Arnold, The 12 Days of Redneck Christmas, which takes a look at Christmas traditions, premiered on CMT in 2008.
The theme music is "The Twelve Days of Christmas."
Bela Fleck and the Flecktones recorded a version of the song on their album Jingle All The Way.
Each day is performed in both a different time signature and key signature.
2009
A Piñata in a Pine Tree: A Latino Twelve Days of Christmas, by Pat Mora (Clarion Books, September 2009), provides a festive Latino twist on "The Twelve Days of Christmas," populating it with piñatas in place of partridges, plus burritos bailando (dancing donkeys), lunitas cantando (singing moons), and much more.
In this version, a little girl receives gifts from a secret amiga, whose identity is a sweet surprise at the book's conclusion.
There are things to find and count in Spanish on every page, with pronunciations provided right in the pictures and a glossary and music following the story.
In the US version of The Office's 2009 Christmas episode (season 6, episode 13), Secret Santa, Andy Bernard gives his crush, Erin Hannon, a literal series of gifts following the lyrics of the carol.
She is not happy and addresses to the office that her Secret Santa should stop giving these gifts because of injuries caused by the wild animals.
The episode concludes with Andy admitting it was he who sent the anonymous gifts leading a parade of twelve marching drummers.
The Simpsons' couch gag for Pranks and Greens had a modified version of this song.
TV commercials for Best Buy and the iPhone 3G sang the song with modified lyrics.
Team Four Star parodied the song for their series, Dragonball Z Abridged, with a version called 12 Days of DBZAbridgedmas.
2010
The album Phineas and Ferb Holiday Favorites has a version in which the cast of the animated series Phineas and Ferb list the things they want Santa Claus to bring them.
Gradually, over the course of the song, Dr.
Doofenshmirtz tries to change his wish, and Candace gets increasingly frustrated with not receiving hers (having her brothers get busted), eventually shouting, "Ah, forget it!" at the end of the song.
The wishes are as follows:

4.
A silver guitar (sung by Jeremy ( Mitchel Musso ))
3.
A sash full of patches (sung by Isabella ( Alyson Stoner ))
2.

In Sonny with a chance,Sonny ( Demi Lovato ) sings a parody of this song with a sick accent, as her character, in a special Christmas chapter with Joe Jonas.
2011
The Call of Duty Wiki website made a version of this song, switching the original lyrics with Call of Duty related lyrics and named it "The Twelve Days of MW3", referring to the then-recently released Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.
