The Three Wolf Moon T-shirt gained popularity after attracting ironic reviews on Amazon.com attributing great power to it such as being irresistible to women, striking fear into other males and having magical healing abilities.
These reviews were made mainly by members of the bodybuilding.com Misc section members.
Brian Govern, a law student at Rutgers University, was searching for a school book on Amazon and was led to The Three Wolf Moon T-shirt by an Amazon recommendation which had been targeted at students purchasing college semester books.
He decided to write a review of the shirt on a whim as he did not actually own the shirt.
His faux-serious review as "Bee-Dot-Govern" in November 2008 concluded:
Pros : Fits my girthy frame, has wolves on it, attracts women
Cons : Only 3 wolves (could probably use a few more on the'guns'), cannot see wolves when sitting with arms crossed, wolves would have been better if they glowed in the dark.
Since this original review was posted, more than 1700 similar reviews have been posted.
Some reviewers have uploaded images showing celebrities such as Barack Obama or Steve Jobs wearing the shirt.
The shirt attracted further interest when it became viral on networking sites such as Digg and Facebook and was then lauded in conventional media as an Internet phenomenon.
German scholar Melvin Haack considers it to be a notable example of a redneck joke.
The reviews have been included in study of such online irony.
Such irony tends to confound analysis of customer reviews and so the texts has been analysed to determine which elements might identify irony.
One common example found in n-gram analysis was " alpha male ".
