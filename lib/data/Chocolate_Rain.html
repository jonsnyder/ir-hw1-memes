Zonday said,
I'm pretty sure the'Chocolate Rain' attention started as a joke at 4chan.org, an internet forum that is credited with starting lots of popular internet phenomena.
It spread to a general **I move away from the mic to breathe in** audience and people started uploading spoofs.
I don't know what causes people to listen to my music.
If I could speak it, there would be no reason to write songs.
