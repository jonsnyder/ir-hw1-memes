The paperclip that Kyle MacDonald traded for a house.
The website One red paperclip was created by Kyle MacDonald, a Canadian blogger who bartered his way from a single red paperclip to a house in a series of online trades over the course of a year.
MacDonald was inspired by the childhood game Bigger, Better, and the site received a considerable amount of notice for tracking the transactions.
"A lot of people have been asking how I've stirred up so much publicity around the project, and my simple answer is:'I have no idea' ", he told the BBC.

Trading timeline
MacDonald made his first trade, a red paper clip for a fish-shaped pen, on July 14, 2005.
He reached his goal of trading up to a house with the fourteenth transaction, trading a movie role for a house.
This is the list of all transactions MacDonald made:
On July 14, 2005, he went to Vancouver and traded the paperclip for a fish-shaped pen.
He then traded the pen the same day for a hand-sculpted doorknob from Seattle, Washington, which he nicknamed "Knob-T".
On July 25, 2005, he traveled to Amherst, Massachusetts, with a friend to trade the Knob-T for a Coleman camp stove (with fuel).
On September 24, 2005, he went to San Clemente, California, and traded the camp stove for a Honda generator.
On November 16, 2005, he made a second (and successful) attempt (after having the generator confiscated by the New York City Fire Department ) in Maspeth, Queens, to trade the generator for an "instant party": an empty keg, an IOU for filling the keg with the beer of the holder's choice, and a neon Budweiser sign.
