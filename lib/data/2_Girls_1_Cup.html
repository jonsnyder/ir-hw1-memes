2 Girls 1 Cup is the unofficial nickname of the trailer for Hungry Bitches, a 2007 Brazilian scat-fetish pornographic film produced by MFX Media.
The trailer features two women conducting themselves in fetishistic intimate relations, including defecating into a cup, taking turns ostensibly consuming the excrement, and vomiting it into each other's mouths.
"Lovers Theme" by Hervé Roy, from the movie Delusions of Grandeur, plays throughout.
This one-minute preview is a viral video that became a well-known Internet meme in itself, and for the reactions its graphic content elicited from viewers who have not seen such films before.
Around mid-October 2007, video sites such as YouTube were flooded with videos depicting others' reactions to watching the video for the first time.
Many other reaction videos have now appeared for similarly shocking and extreme videos.

Origin
The video originated from a Brazilian distributor and pornographer Marco Fiorito, who describes himself as a "compulsive fetishist ".
Fiorito originally produced foot fetish videos but soon moved on to coprophagia, the eating of feces.
The film was produced by MFX Video, one of several companies owned by Fiorito.
Authorities in the United States have branded some of his films as obscene and filed charges against Danilo Croce, a Brazilian lawyer living in Florida, listed as an officer of a company distributing Fiorito's films in the United States.
Croce accepted a plea bargain and was sentenced to three years of unsupervised probation and forfeiture of $98,000.
Fiorito said he did not know his films were illegal in the United States and that his films often contained chocolate instead of feces to appease some of his actors who were willing to appear in scat films but not actually eat fecal matter.
The first few seconds of the 2 Girls 1 Cup video contain the text "MFX 1209" (the production code for Hungry Bitches ) and the URL mfxvideos.com, the website of Fiorito's MFX Video, leading some in the media to incorrectly believe the video is one of the many Croce had to surrender to the Department of Justice but was somehow leaked in the process.
Reception
Reaction videos
Part of what has facilitated 2 Girls 1 Cup's spread are the reactions it causes.
Many videos exist on YouTube of users showing the original video (off-camera) to their friends and filming their reactions, although some videos seem to be staged.
Even Joe Rogan, host of Fear Factor, a show notorious for the disgusting things its contestants are dared to eat, had to turn away in a reaction video posted to his blog.
A reaction video starring a Kermit the Frog puppet proved very popular on the community-based website reddit.
In January 2008, Slate documented the reaction video phenomenon with a slideshow featuring various reactions.
Violet Blue, an author, described this website as becoming "the new " tubgirl " and goatse all in one disgusting moment of choco-poo-love" in a San Francisco Chronicle article.
"Genuine Nerd" Toby Radloff was so disgusted by the clip that he had to immediately watch it again.
Veteran porn star Ron Jeremy walked off while watching the video on The Playhouse.
On the same program, singer Wyclef Jean sat through the whole thing without looking away or showing any apparent reaction, all while eating corn on the cob.
Ace Frehley, formerly of KISS, was shown the video on The Opie and Anthony Show in July 2009, and was unfazed, declaring, "Crazier things than that have happened on the road."
Parodies
A short film by guitarist John Mayer to his blog entitled "2 Guys 1 Cup" where Mayer and Best Week Ever correspondent Sherrod Small enjoy Pinkberry frozen yogurt in the same manner that the women in the original consumed the feces.

The German satirical magazine Titanic referred to the photograph of the U.S.
national security team monitoring Operation Neptune's Spear in the White House Situation Room as "2 Girls 1 Cup in the White House".
Media recognition
In the media the video has been used as an example of the poor content quality of YouTube and similar video-sharing websites, and their tendency towards deliberately shocking content.
The video was featured on VH1's Best Week Ever, where the video's existence and propagation was declared to cause "Moral Bankruptcy" to have the "Best Week Ever!" Esquire magazine showed the video to actor George Clooney during an interview, prompting him to compare it to a rodeo, saying the point of the video was to see "how long you can last."
The video is mentioned during a cutaway gag in the Family Guy episode " Back to the Woods ", where Brian shows the video to Stewie and films his reaction with a camera.
Despite his initial revulsion, Stewie decides to search for a possible male alternative.
In Lil Wayne's song "Gonorrhea" he mentions 2 Girls 1 Cup.
In an episode of Tosh.0, the entire audience is filmed reacting to this video.
The Toronto Star's blog covering the 2010 World Cup is titled "Two Guys, One Cup."
The site was featured in a Dr.
Pepper Facebook promotion open to minors, which resulted in The Coca-Cola Company terminating its relationship with the digital marketing agency responsible.
Jim Edwards of BNET said that Coca Cola has full responsibility for allowing the situation to occur, arguing that Coca-Cola selected an advertising agency that openly advertised "profane" advertising campaigns and that the Coca-Cola executive who approved the 2 Girls 1 Cup line failed to do research on what the name meant.
The cast of Avenue Q, responding to the Muppets' version of Bohemian Rhapsody, made a video of We Will Rock You / We Are The Champions (known as "We Will Rock Q"), ending with Nicky surfing the internet, finding 2 Girls 1 Cup (indicated by the soundtrack), and vomiting as the screen faded to black.
Canadian comedians Scott Thompson and Kevin McDonald of the The Kids in the Hall sketch comedy group perform a show called "Two Kids, One Hall".
Episode 4 of the first season of the MTV comedy series " Death Valley " is called "Two Girls, One Cop".
