Little Superstar is a video uploaded on YouTube, which is a clip from the 1990 Indian film Adhisaya Piravi, starring Rajinikanth.
The clip features the dwarf South Indian actor Kingkong breakdancing to MC Miker G &amp;
DJ Sven's " Holiday Rap ".
The title "Little Superstar" presumably originates from the nickname of the film's lead actor, Rajinikanth, who is generally coined as a superstar.
Various mashups have also appeared on the Internet using tracks from Cypress Hill, Michael Jackson and others.
The video has been featured on YouTube, in Tom Anderson's bulletins on Myspace, on the E!
TV show The Soup, the MSNBC shows Countdown with Keith Olbermann and Tucker Carlson, G4TV's Attack of the Show!
and elsewhere, as well as having been parodied on Saturday Night Live.
Another popular video clip features Thavakalai slapping a man from the same movie.
In recent years, actor Kingkong has choreographed a dance number in a Doritos Tandoori Sizzler!
commercial shown in Canada, which was filmed in India.

Transcript of the video
The language spoken in the clip is Tamil.
The rough English equivalent would be:
Dancing clip
Mother: Hey, hey.
What's with the party early morning?
Get out everybody, shoo, shoo.
Why not take some rest, dear?
Rajinikanth: OK Mom.
Kingkong: Dude, give me a beedi.
Rajinikanth: Hey!
Kids shouldn't smoke.
Kingkong: Buddy, I'm ten years older than you.
Give it to me I say.
Rajinikanth: And if I don't?
Kingkong: I'll skin you alive.
Rajinikanth: Here you go.
Slapping clip
Kingkong: Brother, you don't worry about this silly duel.
I'll take care of this myself (with my hands).
Rajinikanth: Ok.
(Kingkong slaps thug)
Kingkong: Dude, how (am I doing)?
Rajinikanth: Great!
Rajinikanth: Enough.
He's going to die!
Rajinikanth: Well, is this enough or do you want a piece of me too?
Misconceptions
The clips were incorrectly reported as being from Bollywood, which predominantly refers to the filmmaking industry of Hindi films, in some places on the web and TV media, such as YouTube, Yahoo and the "Oddball Plays of the Month" segment of Keith Olbermann show on MSNBC.
The film is actually from Tamil cinema, colloquially known as Kollywood, the Tamil filmmaking industry based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.
Kingkong has been incorrectly described as a child actor in some places.
He is actually an adult with dwarfism.
He was also never known as a "little superstar" in the Tamil film industry and is only the phenomenal title of the clip given by its uploaders.
However, the protagonist of the film, Rajinikanth (actor lying on the cot in the video), is known as a "Superstar" in India.
In popular culture
A parody version of "Little Superstar" starring porn star Ron Jeremy first started turning up on video sharing websites in March 2007.
Another parody starring Fred Armisen as Kingkong and Bill Hader as Rajinikanth aired on Saturday Night Live on April 21, 2007.
Nobody's Watching also created a parody of the video.
A parody of "Little Superstar" appeared in the season finale Gorillas in the Mist (American Dad!) of the sixth season of American Dad!
