Abusive practices
FreeCreditReport.com has been the subject of two major lawsuits.
In 2005, the site's owner, Experian Consumer Direct, was sued by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive marketing tactics.
They settled for $950,000 in the form of free credit monitoring for those affected and agreed not to use deceptive and misleading claims about free offers and to offer full disclosure of terms and conditions of any free offers.
The penalty was largely seen as ineffective since it amounted to a small fraction of the $72 million dollar annual advertising budget for free credit report.
They were further subjected to a 2006 inquiry by the Florida Attorney General for violating Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.
An MSNBC.com investigation of the website called it "misleading", "deceptive" and a "scam".
The program has also been identified as a scam by ConsumerFraudReporting.org.
The advertising practices of FreeCreditReport.com were specifically addressed in the Credit CARD Act of 2009.
Now any company who advertises a'free credit report' on TV or radio must include the statement: "This is not the free credit report provided for by Federal law." The law also calls for the Federal Trade Commission to issue new rules that will force free credit report advertisers to inform consumers that the only place for a free credit report is AnnualCreditReport.com.
Advertising
Singing ad campaign
In October 2007, Experian Consumer Direct began airing an advertising campaign featuring singer Eric Violette as a man struggling with difficult life circumstances due to his poor credit score, and his ignorance of it.
The commercials feature jingles written using various distinctive forms of popular music.
To date the company has aired nine different commercials, which have aired in different orders in different markets.
The commercials featuring Violette and his band stopped airing in February 2010 to focus advertising on FreeCreditScore.com and a new band.
The themes/motifs of the commercials include, in order:
Pirate-themed restaurant
Living with in-laws
Country Western stage show
Renaissance Fair
Used car
Bicycle riding
Hip-hop pool party
Roller Coaster
Small town / cell phone shop
Country Bar in Reno
Most feature references to the original "Pirate" commercial;
either lyrically, or by including it as part of the background.
Violette was born June 12, 1981 in Montreal and attended the National Theatre School of Canada in 2002.
The commercials prepared by David Muhlenfeld &amp;
Shakur Green at the The Martin Agency began appearing in October 2007.
Due to Violette's Canadian French accent, his voice has been dubbed in the United States.
He earlier did a Sirius Satellite Radio commercial in French.
When asked about his character by the Washington Post, Violette said that "He's a guy who has a lot of dreams and hopes.
But he's not able to make them concrete because I think he's a little bit lazy.
He's the kind of guy who always has bad luck.
.
.
but I'm sure he has a good heart."
The commercials have spawned various homages including many parodies on YouTube.
MADtv parodied the ads in a sketch that featured a young man cursed by bad luck after getting a credit card his senior year of high school.
After racking up $80,000 in debt, he ends up in jail, escapes and eventually winds up living with a skinhead named Fang "in a soggy cardboard box".
The Federal Trade Commission produced two public service announcements parodying the commercials to remind citizens of the right to annual free credit reports from annualcreditreport.com.
Freecreditscore Band Campaign
In May 2010 a nationwide band search began to find the new face of freecreditscore.com.
Live auditions were held in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
Bands could also submit videos of themselves online at freecreditscoreband.com for consideration.
Many were typical entries, but some bands, apparently as a joke, submitted videos as well, most notably Comparative Anatomy (band).
In August 2010 The Victorious Secrets were named the new FCS Band.
FCS Commercial Themes:
"Check It" featuring the new FCS iPhone App
"Secret" features the band in a golfing course
"Ocean View" features the band in a man's poorly located home
"Co-Signing 101" features the band as a "cover band" at a dorm room party
"Global Nomad" features the band singing in an airport
