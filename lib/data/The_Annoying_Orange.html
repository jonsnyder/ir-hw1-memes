Website
The Annoying Orange is an American comedy web series created by Dane Boedigheimer in 2009.
It stars an anthropomorphic orange named The Annoying Orange (often simply referred to as "orange") who annoys fruits, vegetables and other objects in each episode by telling rude puns and jokes.
Due to the popularity of the show, The Annoying Orange has also become the subject of a TV series, a video game, toys, shirts, costumes and other accessories.

Plot
The show is centered on an anthropomorphic orange named The Annoying Orange who resides on a kitchen counter, which he shares with his best friend Pear, a Bartlett pear, also voiced by Boedigheimer.
Other fruits on the counter include Passion, a female passionfruit played by Justine Ezarik, a grapefruit, a tiny apple known as Midget Apple, a small marshmallow, and an elderly lemon named Grandpa Lemon.
Most episodes consist of Orange heckling other characters, who often become annoyed and meet a sudden and gruesome end, usually by evisceration with a chef's knife (although the implements used to cut them up range from a blender to a toy pinwheel ).
Orange usually tries to warn them before it happens, by blurting out the weapon-in-use, such as "Knife!"
Orange has several recurring mannerisms.
He often begins an episode by stating "Hey, (name of character)!" until they get frustrated enough to respond, and often refers to said character as a play on the object's name or appearance.
He uses various tactics to annoy people, such as by telling rude and offensive jokes, burping, and making childish noises with his tongue.
Orange has a braying laugh as annoying as his voice, and he often tells the objects he annoys, "You're an apple!" if he does not like them.
Characters
From left to right: Midget Apple, Pear, Orange, Grapefruit, Passion Fruit, Marshmallow and Grandpa Lemon.
Main
Orange is the lead protagonist and main character of the series, appearing in every episode since the series began on October 9, 2009.
He has yellow teeth, grey eyes, and a braying laugh.
His standard reply, uttered after being taken to task for being so annoying, is: "No, I'm not.
I'm an orange!" Boedigheimer describes the character as a composite of people in his life, saying, "Everyone knows somebody like him: They don't listen, they are annoying, and at the same time they are kind of lovable".
Pear made his initial (albeit brief) appearance in the first episode, before becoming a regular character since the episode Passion of the Fruit.
He is a Bartlett pear who inhabits the same kitchen counter as Orange, his best friend.
Despite their friendship, he is often annoyed by the Orange, to the point where he initially wants to die, although subtly warming up to the Orange's antics afterwards.
Pear tries to help others maintain control, and is depicted as being more intelligent than Orange.
Passion Fruit (voiced by YouTube vlogger iJustine ), or simply Passion, first appeared on February 19, 2010 in Passion of the Fruit.
Passion is offended by frequent insults and will try to settle issues to stop Orange from being annoying and scolds the other characters.
Orange has a crush on her, much to the unbeknownst of Passion.
Passion has a twin sister named Mandy, noticed in Wishful Thinking, who is in love with Pear.
Midget Apple was first seen in the episode Crabapple.
Also voiced by Dane Boedigheimer, he is a tiny Red Delicious apple.
A friend of Orange, Pear, Passion, and especially Marshmallow, he dislikes being called "Midget Apple", preferring the term " Little Apple".
Marshmallow debuted in the episode Annoying Saw 2: The Annoying Death Trap on September 24, 2010.
He is a small, childlike, squeaky-voiced marshmallow that Orange becomes friends with in the episode.
Marshmallow is typically presented as cheerful and happy, and claims to love "puppies, and unicorns, and bunnies, and rainbows, and clouds, and kittens, and bunnies, and rainbows".
The character is shown to absorb significant damage to his body, such as from cuts, fire, and throwing stars, and emerge largely unscathed.
Despite his cuteness, size, and cheerfulness, when something or someone angers him, he tends to act destructively, both to his friends and the area around him.
Recurring
Grapefruit, voiced by Robert Jennings, first appeared in Passion of the Fruit as Orange's archenemy.
He often engages in juvenile insults with Orange.
The character was killed by Knife in his debut, but became a recurring character after being resurrected as part of the Frankenfruit monster in Frankenfruit.
Grandpa Lemon, played by Kevin Brueck, is an elderly lemon who is forgetful and has a habit of falling asleep.
First appearing in Grandpa Lemon on June 4, 2010, he is unfazed by Orange's taunts due to his memory loss and sleeping habit.
Sliced in half by Knife in his debut, he became part of the Frankenfruit monster in Frankenfruit, and has become a recurring character ever since.
Knife, voiced by Kevin Nalty, was initially introduced simply as a kitchen tool in The Annoying Orange.
He appears when Orange announces his presence, proceeding to slice up the other fruits and vegetables.
His first appearance as a character was in No More Mr.
Knife Guy.
Knife is shown to be at odds with his role in the series, hating his life because of how he is used.
His mortal enemy is a knife sharpener due to the pain involved.
Liam the Leprechaun, played by Robert Jennings, first appeared in the episode Luck o' the Irish as a bad-tempered leprechaun, who loses his pot of gold to Orange.
Crushed by his pot of gold at the end of the episode, Liam had returned in several episodes and is also the title character of a spin-off series on his own YouTube channel.
Production and history
Before the Annoying Orange, Dane Boedigheimer had done many talking food videos for his channel and other sites including JibJab.
He said in an interview that the idea was a combination of how many talking food videos, puns and special effects he came up with and did before.
The original video was originally meant to be the only Annoying Orange video on YouTube.
However, since many viewers liked the character, a few more Annoying Orange videos were released on his channel daneboe.
Following the success of the series, he created a channel dedicated to The Annoying Orange under the name realannoyingorange on January 11, 2010.
New episodes of The Annoying Orange are released on a weekly basis, with a few exceptions.
The episodes are released every Friday on realannoyingorange's YouTube channel.
To animate the characters, Boedigheimer superimposes the voice actor's eyes and mouth onto the object they are playing.
For instance, Boedigheimer uses his own eyes and mouth to play both Orange and Pear (although Orange's mouth has been slightly modified, so that it has a distinctive orange tint to it, while the color of Pear's mouth is unadjusted) and does the same for all guest actors who voice the animated characters.
Since Boedigheimer isn't a very good writer, Boedigheimer's partner and friend, Spencer Grove, writes the plot of the episodes.
In the early episodes, Dane Boedigheimer played Orange and all the fruits and vegetables, but this has since changed to include at least one guest actor/YouTuber in each episode.
These have included Robert Jennings/bobjenz who played Grapefruit, Ginger, and Liam the Leprechaun (which spun off into his own series), Justine Ezarik /iJustine (which led to her becoming a recurring cast member), Lucas Cruikshank, Take180's Evan Ferrante, and Weezer.
Two crossovers were created as the result of guest appearances.
On June 24, 2010, Boedigheimer guest-starred as Orange in Lucas Cruikshank's Fred Goes Grocery Shopping!
Cruikshank soon returned the favor by playing Fred Figglehorn in the episode Annoying Orange vs.
FRED!!!'.
In August 20, 2010, Ferrante appeared as the leader of a race of broccoli aliens in the episode Close Encounters of the Annoying Kind one day after Boedigheimer appeared in Ferrante's Take180 series "Not Tom Cruise" as Orange.
Three of Weezer's members appeared as objects on a party platter in Wazzup 3: Bonsai Tree, with lead singer Rivers Cuomo appearing as the title object.
The appearance was part of Weezer's promotion of their album Hurley, where they took to several YouTube channels including daneboe and Fred to promote the record.
In December 17, 2010, in honor of his website Openfilm, actor James Caan appeared as a jalapeño pepper in Jalapeño.
Reception
In June 2010, the channel received 137 million views.
On August 13, 2010, the series' YouTube channel received 1 million subscribers.
The series was rated as the most viewed web series of February and March 2010 by Mashable, with over 52 million views.
On April 26, 2010, the series had over 108 million views on YouTube.
On June 2011, the channel was ranked as the eighth most subscribed and 30th most viewed, with more than 2,000,000 subscribers.
As of January 13, 2012, the series has hit 1 billion channel views and 2.3 million subscribers.
Despite the show's popularity, it has received some negative critical response.
Liz Shannon Miller stated the show to be "annoying for many reasons." In the web series column Pass the Mustard, Ned Hepburn called the show "pure, pure unfunny highly concentrated, in droplet form, just purely nonsensical riffing from an Annoying Orange." Ned said in Conclusion " the Annoying Orange series is one of the few that I had a physically bad reaction to.
It was horrible." 411mania.com called the show "idiotic" and "creepy as hell" while other publications have called it "third grade humor".
